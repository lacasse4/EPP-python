    An EPP structure is normally populated by calling epp_reader.parse().
    
    A peer evaluation is done amongst a team of several students (normaly 4 or more).
    It is performed by students once homework has been hande over or a major milestone
    has been reached. In this process, each student evaluates its peer team member
    across several aspect (ex. quality of work, quantity of work done, leadership, etc.)
    The goal of this program is to compute a "factor" that is used to "modulate"
    the score given to the team for a homework.  That is, the factor should be
    multiplied with the team score in order to obtain the student score.
    For example, a student poorly evaluated during a peer review has a factor - 0.8.
    If the team's score for the homework is 80%, then the student score will be:
        student_score = 0.8 * 80 / 100 = 64%.
        
    min_scale and max_scale are respectively the minimm score and the maximum score
    that can be given to an aspect during the evaluation.  The min_scale should be
    0 or 1. The max scale is typically an integer value between 3 and 5 depending
    on the scale used. For example, the following scale:
        0 - inadequate
        1 - poor
        2 - average
        3 - good
        4 - excellent
