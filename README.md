Peer Review Application (Évaluation Par les Pairs)<br>
Author: Vincent Lacasse (vincent.lacasse@etsmtl.ca)
<p>
The application computes a factor which represents the evaluation of a student as evaluated by its coworkers.
This application will take a CSV file as an input. The CSV file is the output of the 
'Export des Évaluations, sans multiligne' function of Workshop ÉTS.
The application outputs a XLSX file including the factor for each single evaluated students.
